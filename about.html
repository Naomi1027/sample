                    <h2>About Sizen</h2>
                    <p>When I was in my 20s, I had the opportunity to meet many farmers in Miyazaki through work.
                        Most of the farmers are married couples, and they all have very good relationships with each other
                        and are all nice people. Is it possible that touching the earth and soil has a mysterious power 
                        that cleanses your mind? That's what I thought.
                        Many of the farmers I met did not use pesticides or chemical fertilizers,
                        and they were intelligent and knowledgeable people,
                        so they were able to put their hardships behind them and practice naturalfarming methods.
                        was doing. However, to compensate for the labor involved in catching insects by hand,
                        we were not adding value to the product, even though we were making something
                        that was really good for the body. It's a shame that such a wonderful product is not known to many people!
                        So, I thought it would be possible to add real value to the ingredients of farmers
                        who have this belief and deliver them to consumers. At that time,
                        I came across an offer to open a rest house at Heiwadai Park, a tourist destination in Miyazaki.
                        Even though it was a tourist spot, it wasn't a very popular place,
                        as I had only been there once on an excursion when I was a child.
                        However, when I went there as an adult, I realized that it was a wonderful place full of nature,
                        with a lush green forest where you could always hear the chirping of birds. Here too,
                        I thought it was a waste that there were no people here.
                        I suddenly had an idea!
                        It would be so wonderful to create a restaurant in this lush green park
                        where you can enjoy authentic food from your favorite farmers! and.
